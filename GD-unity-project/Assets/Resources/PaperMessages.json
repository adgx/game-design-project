      "content": "<color=red>Day 27</color>\nDuring field amplification, a repulsive spike of 4.7 Tesla emerged, launching the test object against the wall and causing severe structural damage. In the subsequent phase, the emission produced a concentrated release along the propagation axis, capable of piercing a moving target three meters away and compromising its mechanical stability. The phenomenon appears promising for applications involving impulsive force control or precise long-range energy transmission."

      "content": "<color=red>Day 41</color>\nDuring the flow maintenance test, the sphere generated a stable, hemispherical field that remained consistent even under prolonged stress. Multiple collisions were simulated using dense alloy bodies, moving at controlled speeds along radial trajectories. The field dissipated every impact without signs of instability or measurable dispersion."

      "content": "<color=red>Day 56</color>\nThe sphere is still not fully controllable. It locked onto a secondary console and opened all doors in Section D, directly interfacing with the circuit. Fortunately, no further anomalies were recorded, except interference with vending machines, which dispensed credit without input."

      "content": "<color=red>Day 63</color>\nDespite results aligning with the model, I can’t shake the feeling that something is eluding us. The sphere responds to stimuli with variable latency, as if learning. Logged an energy fluctuation unexplainable by any known variable."

      "content": "<color=red>Day 69</color>\nThe magnetic field is deforming anomalously. Subjects exposed to the center show signs of acute cognitive dissociation. There is also the hypothesis that individuals not synchronized with the sphere's core may gradually lose corporeal coherence."

      "content": "<color=red>Day 83</color>\nToday, the operator corrected a mistake before it happened. No memory of the reason—just avoided the module breach. Structural déjà vu or pre-stimulus? Something is coming back."

      "content": "<color=red>Day 91</color>\nCollected data shows that magnetic field bursts generate a form of cyclical energy return: each impulse tends to fold back on itself within a tight temporal arc. This setup creates a kind of closed-loop in space-time, which may result in an actual time loop. A parallel safety protocol is now urgent."

      "content": "<color=red>Day 104</color>\nMy synchronization with the spherical core may preserve my bodily coherence, but nothing is certain regarding cognitive and mnemonic functions. If the worst happens, my only hope is that I’ll find these pages again."

      "content": "<color=red>Day 112</color>\nThe following notes are not logs. They are instructions. Magnetic data analysis indicates exponential degradation of environmental coherence. According to the latest predictive model, the system can sustain a maximum of six full recursions before collapse. The Recovery Protocol must be completed within the sixth cycle, or there will be nothing left to save."
